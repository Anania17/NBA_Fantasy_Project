🏀 NBA Fantasy Performance Predictor

An end-to-end data science project for predicting NBA player fantasy performance using real-world data.

📘 Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts which NBA players will perform best in fantasy basketball over upcoming games.
The tool will serve as a personal assistant for lineup decisions in fantasy leagues — starting from data collection all the way to a simple dashboard.

🎯 Goals

Ingest near-live NBA data from public APIs or scraped sources

Build a clean and reusable data pipeline

Engineer statistical and contextual features (rolling averages, rest days, matchups, etc.)

Train and evaluate predictive models for fantasy performance

Deploy a minimal dashboard or API for daily use

🧠 Motivation

Fantasy basketball success depends on identifying undervalued players.
By applying machine learning to historical data, we can uncover performance trends and make smarter picks.
