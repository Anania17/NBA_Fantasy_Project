# NBA_Fantasy_Project
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts which NBA players will perform best in fantasy basketball over upcoming games. The tool will serve as a personal assistant for lineup decisions in fantasy leagues â€” starting from data collection all the way to a simple dashboard.
